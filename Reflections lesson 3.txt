Reflections Lesson 3

Remote repository
—create one in gitHub
—git remote (on local - lists all repositories)
—git remote add origin <url>  (copy from gitHub)
—git remote -v
—git push origin master  (push master from local to origin on remote)

Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to view your work from another computer, or share it with a co-worker
